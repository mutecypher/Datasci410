So we've looked at some basics of discrete probability.
We've talked about the axioms of probability.
Let's talk about how we can-- and it looks like from my diagram here,
we can do some set operations because we have our sample space.
We have some subsets.
So what kind of set operations can you do on discrete probabilities?
Well, for one thing, you can do intersection.

So we can say, the probability of the intersection of A--
we use an upside down U for that--
with B equals, well, it's just those two.
So it's 2 out of 10 equals 0.2.
So that's our intersection.
We can do a union.

Not too surprising, since we did an intersection.
So in this case, we use a right-side up U. And we see there's 8 out of 10.
So our union has a probability of 0.8 because that's
all the points that are in A and B.
But we can also expand this, right?
We can expand this, and we can say it's the probability of A
plus the probability of B--
but that's going to give us too big a number--
minus the probability of that intersection, A intersection B.
So that's the union.

And what else can we do?
We can do negation.

So we can write something like P not A. And that is, as you can see,
4 out of 10 equals 0.4.
We can also expand that in a similar way we did this.
And you could do some complex set operation, like you could say,
what's the probability of not the union A, B, you'd say.
And that is just then the probability of the union of not A not B
because you can just play through by the negation, which is, in this case,
just 2 out of 10 equals 0.2.
So that's just some basic set operations, intersection, union,
negation.
And given those, we can do more complex set operations
as we might need to to compute various probabilities.
