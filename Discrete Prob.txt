So let's talk about some basics of discrete probability.
By discrete probability, we mean events--
for example, there can be events that either happen or don't happen,
or there could be a count--
like two people, three people, six people--
those are discrete events, because they happen in discrete numbers.
You can basically, maybe, have countable number of integers or something
like that, so it's discrete, as opposed to continuous variables.
Temperature is a continuous, so it's not discrete.
So here's an example here.
So we have this sample space--
let's call it C --which I've drawn in this box,
and you can see I've got 10 dots in C. And I've got
these subspaces that are my subsamples.
So one is called A, one is called B, and you can see they have an intersection
here.
So we can do a number of things with this.
We can start out by computing what's the probability of A. So
that's the probability that one of these events--
say these events are going to occur, and there's 10 possible events here.
So the probability of A equals the number in A
over the number in the whole set--
the whole sample space, which we're going to call S. And that
happens to be the same as C. And in this case we find out that it's 0.6.
Because we have six out of 10 events occurred in A.
We can do the same thing for B. I'm going
to switch colors here, so I'll keep blue for B. So the probability of B--
again, it's just the number in B divided by the number in the entire sample
space, and that is 0.4, because you see there's four events out of 10 that
happened in B.
So it's pretty simple, right.
We have these sets, and we can simply work with these sets--
sets and subsets, and compute probabilities just
based on counts in this case.
