So now we're ready to actually make some plots.
And I just wanted to give you a preview of the chart types
we're going to go through in this lesson.
And they're all, for the most part, what I call one
dimensional, or univariate, plot types.
The first one is a bar plot, which is a way to display counts or frequencies,
like we did in a frequency table.
We're going to look at a histogram, which is another univariate plot,
but it displays the frequencies of the values
of a numeric variable, which has been binned into the bins of the histogram.
Then we'll get into some chart types where we can do a little more.
We can use a categorical variable.
We can apply some Group By operations, like box plots.
And I'll explain as we go what a box plot is or a violin plot.
And there's a third-- there's one other univariate plot, which
is the kernel density estimation plot.
And that is like a histogram, but it's a smooth version of a histogram.
So we'll look at that.
And you'll see how kind of combining the best ideas of a kernel density
estimation plot and a histogram and a box plot
leads to this thing we'll call a violin plot.
So that's the game plan.
And we're just going to go through each of those plot types.
