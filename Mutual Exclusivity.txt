So there are two concepts in probability that people often get confused,
but they're really different.
So let's spend a little time on those.
And those are independence.

And the other one is mutual exclusivity.

OK, so independence, we've kind of talked about that actually.
So what we said was that the probability of the union of A and B
equals the probability of A plus the probability of B,
if and only if the probability of A intersection with B
is empty or a null set, so that is independent.
So by independence, we--
so it has other implications in terms of conditional probabilities don't matter,
you know, for example, the probability of B
given A equals just the probability of B, If they're independent right.
Now let's talk about exclusivity.
So what we mean by that is, again, we say
the probability of A intersected with B equals an empty set, right,
and the probability of A, the union of A and B equals probability of A
plus the probability of B.
So that's just the independence.
It's the same as independence.
But this can happen if and only if one of two things happen,
that probability of A equals 0 or empty set or the probability of B
is an empty set.
So that basically says they're mutually exclusive.
If you have B, you can't have A. So it's an or there.

Or either have B and you don't, and there's no A, or you have B, or A,
and there's no B.
So if either those conditions are true and it's an or, if they're both true,
then you just have, and then you don't have anything.
But if that's true, then you have this kind of mutual exclusivity.
So only A can happen, or only B can happen.
And that's what we mean by mutual exclusivity.
So keep that in mind.
There's independence, there's mutually exclusivity.
And they're not really the same concepts.
They seem kind of similar, and they give similar kinds of results in some cases,
but they're really not the same.
