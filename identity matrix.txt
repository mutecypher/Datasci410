To introduce the identity matrix, we first make a comparison
to real numbers and multiplication.
To get the identity object, we ask what number can we multiply by
to get back the same number.
The answer, when dealing with numbers and multiplication is 1.
For example, 5 times 1 is that we get back 5.
This means that the number 1 is the identity value for multiplication
among real numbers.
When dealing with matrices and multiplication,
the equivalent identity holds for square matrices.
A times B is equal to the identity times A times B, which
is equal to A times B times I. The identity is a square matrix with ones
down the diagonal and zeroes elsewhere.
So here, we have that equation where I times AB is communitive.
So we can execute this code here and see that the identity we indeed
get back the results we would expect.
Number systems may also have inverses.
If we go back to the real numbers and multiplication,
we have already observed that the number 1 is the identity.
We can also ask, given a number, what do we multiply
it to get the identity as a result?
So for example, what do we multiply 5 by to get 1?
We multiply it by 1/5 to get the identity.
This means that the inverse of 5 is 1/5.
Matrices also may have an inverse.
We just have to ask, given a square matrix
A, what do I have to multiply it by to get the identity matrix?
Whatever that is, that will be the inverse of A.
In principle, we can compute and denote it as such.
Here is how we would denote it, a inverse times A,
we get back the identity.
So here's how we can compute it.
Accessing the linear algebra methods in numb pi, we can call the inverse of m--
m is a two by two matrix here--
and here is its inverse.
If we multiply it by the inverse, we indeed get the identity out.
And it's the same if you left multiply or right multiply.
