So now we're going to talk about probability distribution.
So we've talked about combinatorics, and we've used some of that
to compute probabilities, mostly discrete probabilities,
and we looked at some examples.
We've looked at conditional probability.
Now let's talk about some particular probability distributions
that we use over and over again in data science.
So this section, I'm just going to go through a number of those,
so you gain some understanding of what those distributions are
and why we use them.
So this whole thing of probability distributions
and a lot of the modern study of probability
started with this guy, Jacob Bernoulli, looking very dapper
with his collar and everything.
And he was a very famous, you know, productive 17th century,
late 17th century mathematician and probabilist.
He wrote a book, which he never quite finished,
and it wasn't published until 1813, about eight years after his death.
And it's the first kind of a textbook or a monograph on probability theory.
So you know, Bernoulli was a big guy in probability theory.
He really pioneered it, and he wrote the first book.
