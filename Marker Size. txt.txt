So we looked at color, and we use color as an aesthetic
to add another dimension to our plot.
So we had three dimensions at that point.
Let's add a fourth dimension to that same plot.
And we're going to do that using marker size, and we
can use marker size for a numeric variable
or as we said possibly an ordered categorical variable.
So on my screen, I have the code that I'm going to demonstrate here.
And everything is the same that we already
talked about for the color example where we set hue
based on the two values of fuel type.
But size, it turns out, there's nothing in seaborne
that lets me set marker size.
But there's this s argument for scatter plots and matplotlib, and that is size.
So we're just going to do auto [INAUDIBLE] price of engine size.
So now our marker size is going to change depending
on how big the engine of the car is.
And you notice all I've done is this is still a Python dictionary,
but I've got a comma here, a new key, which is s,
and then the value for that key, which is the engine size.
And everything else is the same except I've now added yet another line
to my plot title.
Let me run that for you, and we'll scroll down here.
And a long title up there, but it's worth saying what that is.
And again, we have our first aesthetic we dealt with which was color or hue.
So gas and diesel as before.
But now notice that the bubbles, some of these are kind of small
and some of them up here, like our really expensive cars,
have really big engines.
Not too surprising in a way that the more you pay, the bigger the engine
you get.

So now if you think about it, we've got four dimensions projected
onto a two dimensional plot surface.
We have the city miles per gallon, we have the price on the axes,
then we have fuel type of the engine as color.
And we're showing some relative engine size as the size of those markers.
