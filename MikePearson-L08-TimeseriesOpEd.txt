	The article I am writing about is titled “Effect of restricting the legal supply of prescription opioids on buying through online illicit marketplaces: interrupted time series analysis”, the article is posted at https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k2270.The article is about tracking the effects of the US DEA’s ruling in 2014 to reschedule hydrocodone combination products. The DEA changed hydrocodone from a schedule III drug (less restricted) to a schedule II drug (more restricted). This reduced the availability of hydrocodone as a pain reliever. The conclusion of the investigation was that the change in policy coincided with a “significant, sustained increase in illicit trading of opioids through on line US cyryptomarkets.” The report uses an interrupted time series analysis to understand the percentage of drug sales on each day of the for six types of drugs: prescription opioids, prescription sedatives, prescription steroids, prescriptions stimulants, other prescription drugs, and illicit opioids (purchased on the cyryptomarkets). Based upon the analysis, the sales of opioids in the US would have been 6.7% off all drug sales. But the true (or at least, indicated from the data) percentage was 13.7%. The reclassification of hydrocodone increased the sales (in dollars, not necessarily units) of opioids (legal and illicit) substantially.  If the goal of the reclassification was to cut down on the availability of opioids (a laudable goal, given the increase in opioid-related deaths since 1999) then the change was a marked failure. Based upon these results, other approaches to decreasing the use (and overuse) of opioids must be investigated.
