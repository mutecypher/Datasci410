Hello, and welcome.
In this lesson, we're going to talk about time series data
and look at some of the very simplest, basic models
that we use to work with time series data.
They're linear models, which you should be familiar with by now.
They're basically, specialized regression models,
but we'll get to that.
So why do we care about time series?
And the reason is, there's so much data out there that in the real world,
that's time series.
For example, I've done work in logistics and so we do demand forecasting.

So a demand forecast.
So you've got demand for some product or maybe,
traffic on a highway where there's demand or network
traffic on the internet or something like that-- there's demand.
And you want to understand the time sequence of periods
of high and low demand and be able to make sensible forecasts.
So probably, that's one of the most fundamental things
we do with time series.
A lot of medical data is time series-- electrocardiograms,
electroencephalograms.
Often, things a patient's blood pressure history can be viewed as time series.
So there's a lot there.
In engineering and science, there's just all kinds of experimental data
that are time series.
Signal processing is a time series process.
Things like that.

Markets, like capital markets, and macroeconomics.

Time series data-- if you listen to the business news,
you'll hear them say, that the Commerce Department announced today
that seasonally adjusted unemployment is 4.7% or something like that.
So we'll actually talk about that in this lesson.
What do they mean by this seasonal adjustment stuff?
How do they figure that out?
So that's a fundamental thing and it shows up in all these domains and many,
many more.
I'm just scratching the surface here.
But there is a huge number of data science problems that are time series.
So that, I hope, gives you some motivation
of why we're going to spend a whole lesson on time series data.
