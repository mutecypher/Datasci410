So there's one concept that's related to probability,
but not quite probability, which is called odds.
And odds do show up in data science.
They mostly they show up in gambling.
But the general idea of odds is it's basically
the count in favor to the count against.

OK, so let's say we want to-- what's the odds, odds of a 6?

When you're playing dice, that the one dice is going to come up 6.
So there's one chance in favor.
Basically, there's only one way.
If you're rolling a single die, there's only one way to roll a 1 or a 6.
And there's five possible ways you can roll other numbers.
So you say the odds of rolling a 6, when you throw a single die is 1 in 5.
And there's a relationship between probability and odds.
It's a little messy.
But let's go through it.
So we say that the probability of some event A is, you know,
as we said before is the count of possible ways
A can happen over the possible--
all possible events in our sample space, S.
So we can rewrite that as A over S minus A plus A.
All right, that seems a little weird.
But some brackets there.
And that then equals A over A plus B. So we're going to call this B.
And that is count in favor over count in favor.
See that's our A. Look S minus A are the possible ways you cannot get A.
So plus count against.

So let's do a simple example here.
What's the probability of heads when we roll a fair
or when we flip a fair coin?

So there's one way to do it.
So basically the odds--
the odds for heads, if it's a fair coin is 1 to 1, right?
There is one way it can be heads, one way it cannot be heads, right?
So if we plug into this formula, you got 1
plus 1, which counts in favor, count against is again, just 1.
So it equals 1/2.
So that looks like it works.
So that's just the odds.
Odds are used sometimes, not as much as probability,
but remember it says count in favor to count against,
and you can transform between probability and odds if you so need to.
