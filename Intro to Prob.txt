So now we've spent some time previously on [INAUDIBLE]..
And you've looked at combinations and permutations and how we compute them.
But we can now take that and use those as the basis
to compute discrete probabilities of various things, like for example, dice.
Because you can look at-- dice can--
they're independent.
So there's two dice you typically roll.
And they can, independent of each other, come up anywhere from 1 to 6
and your total score is the sum of that.
So you can have total scores from 2 to 12.
And by looking at the possible permutations of that,
you can compute the frequency that you expect each score to come up with.
But also normalized to the probability.
