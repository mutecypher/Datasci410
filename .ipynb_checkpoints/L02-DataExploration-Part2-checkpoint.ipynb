    "## Multidimensional Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains an introduction to the multidimensional visualization methods data scientists used to explore the relationships between the variables in complex data sets. Data scientists spend a lot of time working on understand the relationships within the variables in the data (**data exporation**). Visualization is a key skill for any data scientist performing these tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inherently, computer displayed  graphics are two-dimensional. Yet, we often wish to display mutli-dimensions of a data set to better understand the relationships between the variables. In this lesson we will explore some of the visualization techniques which can be applied to these problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "These lessons are divided into several parts. In each part you will learn how to use the visualization tools available in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overview of two dimensional plot types** is a reveiw of creating basic plot types used to construct visualizations. These plots naturally display the relationship between two variables on the 2-d computer graphics display. \n",
    "- **Using Aesthetics** is an overview of how to project additional plot dimensions using plot aesthetics. Using aestheics provides a method for projecting additional dimensions onto the 2-d computer graphics display. \n",
    "- **Facetted plotting** also know as conditioned plotting or lattice plotting, introduces a powerful method for visualizing higher dimensional data. Arrays of plots of subsets of the data are arranged on the 2-d computer graphics display. "

Failure to do so will result in plots with many similar colors and marker shapes, which are difficult to understand at best. \n",
