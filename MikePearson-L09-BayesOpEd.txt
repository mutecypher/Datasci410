The Na•ve Bayes article I am writing about is titled ÒHow Machine Learning is Revolutionizing The Study of Galaxies with Image Classification.Ó  The url to the article is https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/how-machine-learning-is-revolutionising-the-study-of-galaxies-with-image-classification/We are currently in a platinum age for astronomy, as lens creation and image processing are improving due to high speed computation. One of the consequences of this is that we have immense numbers new images to evaluate. As an example (from the article) The Sloan Digital Sky Survey produces one million images of galaxies each year. Galaxies are classified by shape Ð and using manual classification is unrealistic for that many images.To quickly and accurately classify new images of galaxies, machine learning is used. Features are extracted using principal component analysis, with a reduction in dimensionality.  After the dimensionality is reduced, a number of machine learning classifiers are trained: SVM, RG, CNN Locally Weighted Regression and Na•ve Bayes. This particular article does not say which method performs best.I did some searching and found an academic paper - http://www.cs.utep.edu/ofuentes/papers/calleja.pdf - that indicates Random Forests work best as a classification scheme, better than Na•ve Bayes. This is an example of machine learning greatly assisting in the classification of images, as more images (in this case, galaxies) become available and require classification to aid our understanding of the cosmos.
