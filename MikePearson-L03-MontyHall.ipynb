    "In 1975, Steve Selvin published a letter in the American Statistician posing the problem of which strategy is optimal. The resulting debate created considerable controversy. This debate was put at full boil when Marilyn vos Savant wrote in her Ask Marilyn column in Parade magazine that the contestant should definitely switch. She was then ridiculed by several statisticians. \n",
